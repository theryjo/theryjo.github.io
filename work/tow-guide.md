__[Towing Guide](https://www.ford.com/trucks/towing-guide/)__ is a single-page application created for Ford Motor Company and launched in June 2022.

Mavice proposed this tool to address a long-standing customer problem: buyers could not search for and compare Ford trucks by towing capacity.

First, the data in brochures (physical and digital) was not structured for searching or filtering. Second, although specifications could be viewed for individual vehicles, they could not be viewed quickly or predictably across more than a few options. For example, a larger engine or more powerful transmission would not necessarily correspond to a higher towing capacity.

The solution was to consolidate and serve towing data in the form of a dynamic digital guide. Information was sourced from brochures and engineering data, normalized, and mapped to known vehicle configurations. In addition to specifications, a mix of static and dynamic (per-vehicle) disclosure information was implemented to ensure legal compliance.

This project demonstrated expertise in designing and shipping customer-oriented data-driven solutions using Adobe Experience Manager, [SPA Editable Components](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-64/developing/headless/spas/spa-overview.html?lang=en), and Vue.

Contributions:
- Vehicle data mapping logic and API (Kotlin)
- Front-end components and refinements (Vue.js)
- Dynamic disclosures engine
